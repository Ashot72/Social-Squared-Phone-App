This is [Lightning Tools](https://lightningtools.com) Social Squared client-side web part (SPFx) Phone app built with [Quasar Framework](https://quasar-framework.org) which is based on Vue.js. 

The phone app is still in development. You will see how to authenticate the app via Azure Active Directory etc. It just takes a minute! You register the app, grant permissions and that is it. The phone app is ready to go and it is really fast! 

You can develop with any Quasar theme, regardless of the platform you are building (material theme for Android and IOS theme). This means that you can test IOS theme on Android during development which is good as it is not always easy to test apps on IOS and we followed it exactly (watch the video).

The app supports different languages. The phone app is demonstrated in conjunction with  [Social Squared client-side web part (SPFx)](https://lightningtools.com/product/social-squared-client-side-web-part) which also works in Microsoft Teams.
